            <h1>BACKGROUND TO BUSAIGA COOPERATIVE SAVING AND CREDIT SOCIETY LTD</h1>
            <h2>1.0 Historical Background to Busaiga Cooperative Saving and Credit Society Ltd</h2>
            <p>
                Busaiga Cooperative Savings and Credit Society Ltd traces its roots from a group of 10 members involved in brewing and selling Local brew (Waragi). 
                The members would brew together to generate money as a group to support their families. However, it was realized that the business of brewing was 
                exclusive to some members of the community especially the born again and other religious sects. In 1991, the members decided to form themselves into 
                a ROSCA where money from individual businesses would be collected and partly given to a single member of the group and save part.
            </p>
            <p>With Mr. Clovice Makune at the helm, the founding members included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mr. Lawrence Kusemererwa</li>
                <li>Mr. Lawrence Kamara (RIP)</li>
                <li>Mr. Arrone Kasaija</li>
                <li>Mr. Edward Kyomya (RIP)</li>
                <li>Miss Joan Bonabana</li>
                <li>Mr. Yosia Katuramu</li>
                <li>Mr. David Mwesige</li>
                <li>Mr. Peter Bakuna</li>
                <li>Mr. Clovice Nyakaana</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By the end of 1998, the group had grown to 30 members on the strength of availability of Banana (Ndizi) ideal for waragi making. The group was hit by the Banana bacteria wilt that saw 
                a reduction in the production of the local brew. Undeterred, the members changed their model to saving small amounts of money which they would on-lend to themselves and distribute the 
                revenue at the end of the year. By the end of 2003, the group had grown to 150. With the dire need to grow to a sustainable institution, 2006 saw the transformation of the informal group 
                into a registered financial Cooperative in the name of Busaiga Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (Busaiga SACCO) under registration No REG NO 6681/RCS.
            </p>
            <p>
                With land provided by one of the members, a home for the SACCO was constructed using their own labour and local construction materials that were readily available within the area 
                (Bikenkya and mud). To date, the SACCO boasts of a modern state-of-the-art office building in Busaiga and a branch network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Busaiga SACCO has sustainably served the communities of Western Uganda including Fort Portal City, Kichwamba, Harugongo and Hakibaale Sub-counties of Kabarole District, 
                Kanara Subcounty in Ntoroka District, and Bundibugyo district.
